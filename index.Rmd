# Multiple Regression Analysis: Step by step

Problem: What are the determinants of COVID-19 vaccination intention?

Objective:
To identify the determinants of COVID-19 vaccination through an application of the Theory of Planned Behavior.

Hypothesis:
H1: Control beliefs have a direct impact on COVID-19 vaccination intention
H2: Utility beliefs have a direct impact on COVID-19 vaccination intention
H3: Social norm beliefs have a direct impact on COVID-19 vaccination intention


Steps to prove the hypothesis

A. Model Evaluation

1. Regression coeficients and r-square
2. Interpretation

B. Regression Model Assumtions

1. Lineality between IVs and Dv
2. Independence of observations: The observation from our model are independent.
3. Homoscedasticity: The errors from our model have equal variance.
4. Normality of Errors: The errors from our model are normally distributed.
5. Multicollinality: evaluate if the IVs are redundant.



Install packages

```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
#install.packages("dplyr")
#install.packages("broom")
#install.packages("ggpubr")
#install.packages("tidyverse")
```

load the packages

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("foreign")
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(broom)
library(ggpubr)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(car)
```

## A. Model Evaluation

### A1. Regression coeficients and r-square

Load the database

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Mydata=read.spss("COVID_data.sav",to.data.frame=T,use.value.labels=FALSE)
View(Mydata)
summary(Mydata$SE_Total)
```

Perform the linear regression analysis


```{r}
Intention_lm <- lm(IN_Total ~ SN_Total + BC_Total + AT_Total, data = Mydata)
summary(Intention_lm)
```

### A2. Interpretation

Bs ajusted: 

For each point obtained in the scale of subjective norms,
the intenton to COVID-19 vaccination intention will increase 0.36 points.
Also, subjective norms had a direct effect on COVID-19 vaccination intention it was statistically significant.

For each point obtained in the scale of Behavioral Control,
the intenton to COVID-19 vaccination intention will increase 0.29 points.
Also, Behavioral Control had a direct effect on COVID-19 vaccination intention and it was statistically significant.


For each point obtained in the scale of Attitude Toward Covid-19 vaccination,
the intenton to COVID-19 vaccination intention will increase 0.45 points.
Also, Attitude Toward Covid-19 vaccination had a direct effect on COVID-19 vaccination intention 
and statistical significance.

The model with these three determinants explain 78% of variance of COVID-19 vaccination intention.


## B. Regression Model Assumtions

### B1. Lineality between IVs and Dv

```{r}
plot(IN_Total ~ SN_Total, data = Mydata)
plot(IN_Total ~ BC_Total, data = Mydata)
plot(IN_Total ~ AT_Total, data = Mydata)
```

### B2. Independence of observations 

The observation from our model are independent.

This was fulfilled when each observation was made by one participant.


### B3. Homocedasticity

The errors from our model have equal variance.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(Intention_lm)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

### B4. Normality of Errors

The errors from our model are normally distributed.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(Intention_lm)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

### B5. Multicollinality: evaluate if the IVs are redundant.

```{r}
vif(Intention_lm)
```
